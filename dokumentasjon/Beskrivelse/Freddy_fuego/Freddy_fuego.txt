As a niño Freddy lived for Friday nights, when 
LUCHA LIBRE(wrestling) would bring his whole family
together infront of the television.
The action, the acrobatics, the masks, the feuds, the emotion;
the only thing that could distract him from the screen was his
abuela’s freshly made food, especially her BURRITOS.

FREDDY’s passion for the lute grew, and when he was old
enough he travelled to CIUDAD DE MEXICO with the dream of
entering the ring as a luchador ‘’wrestler’’. Ten years later
under the ring name FREDDY FUEGO(‘’Fire’’), a dream is
fulfilled; Freddy is a superstar. His flame mask is recognized by his legions of fans from CHAPAS to CHIHUAHUA, and his signature
move ‘’EL TORNILLO’’ strikes fear into the hearts of his
opponents.
